# First thing...

I thank God for graciously, through His mercy, giving me all the necessary knowledge acquired throughout my life and throughout the development of this project. It is only through His grace and provision that this was possible, and I am truly grateful for His presence every step of the way.

**For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.**
`Apostle Paul in Romans 11:36`

# AVideo

AVideo is divided into three distinct components: the streamer, the encoder, and the live server. The streamer is utilized to play and manage videos, while the encoder converts your videos into a web-compatible format. The live server, on the other hand, is used to broadcast live videos.

## Why do I need the Encoder?

There may be several reasons why you may consider installing the encoder, such as having a faster server compared to the public encoder server, or if you prefer a private method for encoding your videos

Additionally, if your server is on a private network and does not have a public IP address, or if it uses an IP address within the 10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8 (Localhost), 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16 range, it is mandatory to install an encoder in order for it to properly communicate with the streamer site.

# Server Requirements

[![Minimum PHP Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7.4%2B-blue)](https://php.net/)
[![Minimum MySQL Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-5.0%2B-blue)](https://www.mysql.com/)
[![Minimum Apache Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache-2.x%20%28mod__rewrite%29-blue)](https://httpd.apache.org/)
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/WWBN/AVideo?include_prereleases&label=AVideo&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/releases)

To run the AVideo Platform, it is necessary to have certain tools installed on your server. Fortunately, all of these tools are available for free. For a comprehensive list of the required tools, please refer to the following link: https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/wiki/AVideo-Platform-Hardware-Requirements.

In summary, you will need:

- PHP version 7.4 or higher
- MySQL version 5.0 or higher
- Apache web server version 2.x with mod_rewrite enabled.

## Important Note: Please Avoid Using Servers with Control Panels

> It is important to note that while the Streamer component can be installed on any server, including Windows, the Encoder and Livestream components are recommended to be installed on a Linux distribution, specifically Ubuntu, without any control panel.

> The reason for this is that control panels such as cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, etc. may limit access to the root system, preventing the installation of necessary libraries and the compilation of certain software. Furthermore, the Livestream component requires the compilation of Nginx, which may not be possible with these control panels.
