/**
 * css for videojs-hls-quality-selector
 * With the default plugins for postcss you can
 * - @import files, they will be inlined during build
 * - not worry about browser prefixes, they will be handled
 * - nest selectors. This follows the css specification that is
 *   currently out on some browsers. See https://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-nesting/
 * - custom properties (aka variables) via the var(--var-name) syntax. See
 *   https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/
